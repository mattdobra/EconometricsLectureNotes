This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

# Stuff for later

## CAPM

Getting the data for this will be a bit tricky; if you want to follow along you will need to install the `tidyquant` and `quantmod` packages -- `install.packages("tidyquant")` should install both for you.  

Let's get some data:

```{r}
library(quantmod)
library(tidyquant)

firstsolar <- tq_get('FSLR', # firstsolar Ticker
               from = "2017-01-01",
               to = "2018-01-01",
               get = "stock.prices")

vanguard500 <- tq_get('VFINX',  # vanguard500 Ticker
               from = "2017-01-01",
               to = "2018-01-01",
               get = "stock.prices")

coke <- tq_get('KO',  # Coke Ticker
               from = "2017-01-01",
               to = "2018-01-01",
               get = "stock.prices")

spx <- tq_get('^GSPC',  # S&P 500 Ticker
               from = "2017-01-01",
               to = "2018-01-01",
               get = "stock.prices")

tbill <- tq_get('^IRX', # 90 day T-bill
               from = "2017-01-01",
               to = "2018-01-01",
               get = "stock.prices")

# Convert stocks prices into daily rates of return

firstsolar <- firstsolar %>% 
    select(date, adjusted) %>% 
    mutate(lnadjusted = log(adjusted)) %>% 
    mutate(firstsolar = lnadjusted - lag(lnadjusted)) %>% 
    select(date, firstsolar)

vanguard500 <- vanguard500 %>% 
    select(date, adjusted) %>% 
    mutate(lnadjusted = log(adjusted)) %>% 
    mutate(vanguard500 = lnadjusted - lag(lnadjusted)) %>% 
    select(date, vanguard500)

coke <- coke %>% 
    select(date, adjusted) %>% 
    mutate(lnadjusted = log(adjusted)) %>% 
    mutate(coke = lnadjusted - lag(lnadjusted)) %>% 
    select(date, coke)

spx <- spx %>% 
    select(date, adjusted) %>% 
    mutate(lnadjusted = log(adjusted)) %>% 
    mutate(spx = lnadjusted - lag(lnadjusted)) %>% 
    select(date, spx)

# t bill quotes are annualized, convert to daily

tbill <- tbill %>% 
    select(date, adjusted) %>% 
    mutate(tbill = adjusted/360) %>% 
    select(date, tbill)

# Combine all the datasets

returns <- spx 
returns <- merge(returns, vanguard500, by = "date")
returns <- merge(returns, firstsolar, by = "date")
returns <- merge(returns, coke, by = "date")
returns <- merge(returns, tbill, by = "date")
returns <- drop_na(returns)
```

This downloads stock ticker data for First Solar (FSLR), Vanguard 500 (VFINX), Coca-COla (KO), and S&P 500 (SPX), and the 3 month T-bill rate (which will be used for our risk-free rate).  Next, we estimate 3 CAPM regressions; one for coke, one for First Solar, and one for the Vanguard 500, and display them in stargazer.

```{r, warning = FALSE}
capm1 <- lm(coke-tbill~spx-tbill, data = returns)
capm2 <- lm(firstsolar-tbill~spx-tbill, data = returns)
capm3 <- lm(vanguard500 - tbill ~ spx - tbill, data = returns)

stargazer(capm1, capm2, capm3, type = "text")
```
This is a model that we actually care about the value of $\alpha$, which represents the risk-adjusted rate of return.  This suggests that both coke and the Vanguard 500 had significantly negative alphas.  In actuality, this is almost certainly not true because the asset returns are daily but the risk adjusted return used is a 3 month return--it would be better to have data with matching time horizons, but I digress.
