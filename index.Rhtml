This page provides companion materials for my book, Prelude to Econometetrics Using R.  You can find this book at <a href="https://bookdown.org/mattdobra/Prelude/">https://bookdown.org/mattdobra/Prelude/</a>.

To aid the reader in following along with the text, below you can find RMarkdown notebooks to the that contain nearly all of the code from this book. 

While I am making the code available, I would strongly avoid you avoid the temptation to  simply copy-and-paste this code into R as you work through the book, or worse, to simply execute the code in these notebooks as-is.   

Sure, this will produce the correct output and this is certainly less work than typing the code yourself. But I think you are far more likely to cultivate your own coding skills by typing the code yourself. In teaching myself R, I found that a large part of the learning process comes from screwing something up and figuring out why the thing I was trying to do failed. And this doesn't happen very often when you cut and paste code that already works.
