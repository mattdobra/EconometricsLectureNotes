This page provides companion materials for my book, <a href="https://bookdown.org/mattdobra/Prelude/">Prelude to Econometrics Using R</a>.

<br><br>

To aid the reader in following along with the text, below you can find RMarkdown notebooks to the that contain nearly all of the code from this book. 

<br><br>

While I am making the code available, I would strongly avoid you avoid the temptation to  simply copy-and-paste this code into R as you work through the book, or worse, to simply execute the code in these notebooks as-is.   

<br><br>

Sure, this will produce the correct output and this is certainly less work than typing the code yourself. But I think you are far more likely to cultivate your own coding skills by typing the code yourself. In teaching myself R, I found that a large part of the learning process comes from screwing something up and figuring out why the thing I was trying to do failed. And this doesn't happen very often when you copy-and-paste code that already works.
