This notebook contains code from Chapters 1 and 2 of [Prelude to Econometrics Using R](https://bookdown.org/mattdobra/Prelude/).  

The companion site to [Prelude to Econometrics Using R](https://bookdown.org/mattdobra/Prelude/) can be found at [https://mattdobra.github.io/EconometricsLectureNotes/](https://mattdobra.github.io/EconometricsLectureNotes/).



```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
